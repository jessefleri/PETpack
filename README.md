# PETpack

#### A tool for comparing popular temperature-based climate models in python

`PETpack.py` module houses a variety of potential evapotranspiration (PET) models that can be called individually or complied with `ET`.

`web_mapper.py` module is a barebone structure to create a [Folium](http://python-visualization.github.io/folium/#concepts) web map. Data is ran through the `ET` compiler to show graphic comparisons of PET models.
